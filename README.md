# ERC-3525
Implementation of ERC-3525 standard

ERC-3525 is a semi-fungible token standard that defines a new asset class of tokens which combines the liquidity features of fungible tokens and the descriptive attributes of non-fungible tokens. 

The standard allows for complex on-chain activities such as repaying a bond issuance to multiple lenders quickly and at a low cost. 

SFTs can represent digital goods that require quantitative fractionalization or combination, such as bonds, coupons, vouchers, invoices, land titles, futures, options and ABS. 

Solv Protocol created the ERC-3525 standard, which was designed by core members of Solv Protocol and propped up by core developers of the Ethereum community. It has replaced ERC-721 as the final standard for Ethereum, and allows fungible tokens to be split.
